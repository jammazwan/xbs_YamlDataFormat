### YamlDataFormat NOTES:

 * simplest possible read and write of simplest possible yaml file
 * minimal testing function - tests a write, merely System.err's a read of a yaml file
 * should give you easy access to extend functionality of each

### To Write a Yaml File

 * run XbsTest
 * notice that my.yml was created
 
### To Read a Yaml File

 * notice that your.yml is already in root of this project, to read
 * run XbsTest
 * notice that the contents of your.yml are now System.err.println()'d to an object
 
This is pretty lame as tests go, but it will get you enough functionality to be able to repeat it in a more meaningful way in your own projects.
